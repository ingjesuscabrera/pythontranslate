Coronavirus infection in humans is commonly associated with lTllld to severe resplratory diseases, with high fever, severe inflammation, cough, and internal organ dysfunction that can even lead to death (92). Most of the ldentlfied coronaviruses cause the common cold in humans. However, this changed when SARS-CoV was identified, paving the way for severe forms of the disease in humans (22). Our previous experience with the outbreaks of other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, suggests that the mode of transmission in COVID-19 as mainly human-to-human transmission via direct contact, droplets, and fomites (25). Recent studies have demonstrated that the virus could remain viable for hours in aerosols and up to days on surfaces; thus, aerosol and foinite contamination could play potent roles ln the translnission of SARS-CoV-2 (257).
The immune response against coronavirus lS vltal  to control and get rid of the infection. However, maladjusted immune responses may contribute to the lmmunopathology of the disease, resultlng in impairment of pulmonary gas exchange. Understanding the interaction  between  CoVs  and host innate immune systems could enlighten our
